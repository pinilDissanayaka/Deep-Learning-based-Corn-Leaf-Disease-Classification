# Deep-Learning-based-Corn-Leaf-Disease-Classification

## Abstract:
This project focuses on the development of a robust disease prediction system for corn or maize plants using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset employed in this study is derived from a compilation of images obtained from the PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets. The dataset is carefully curated to include four distinct classes, each representing a specific corn leaf disease category: Common Rust, Gray Leaf Spot, Blight, and Healthy.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises a total of 4188 images, distributed across the following classes:

1. Common Rust: 1306 images
2. Gray Leaf Spot: 574 images
3. Blight: 1146 images
4. Healthy: 1162 images
   
The data compilation process involved removing images that were deemed not useful for the classification task. It is important to note that the original datasets, PlantVillage and PlantDoc, hold intellectual property rights over the respective datasets. Proper attribution is encouraged when using this dataset for academic research.
